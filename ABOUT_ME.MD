My name is abdelhady abdelaal (abdelhady amr abdelmonem abdelaal), i am a 20 years old web developer, i started my journey back when i was in 6th primary grade when i got my first pc. I was obsessed with online games and always wanted to make my own, i even tried to create private servers of already existing games such as Silk Road Online and 9Dragons Online, that what got me into the world of programming, back then i was only 14 years old, i started learning HTML and CSS and thought thats all i needed to make this work but i failed miserably, fast forward till i was 16 years old my older brother who was already a senior software engineer saw how intriguted and obssessed i was with programming so he offered me a chance. And i, without hesitation took it, i keept learning everything possible about every field that relates in a way to programming, i was amazed by the idea you could create software writing code only and you don't have to pay money for it, i had a taste of nearly everything, fast forward to today (12th of February, 2025) i decided i want to specialize in one field that i can be the go-to guy for that field, and that is web development, specifically Backend Engineering.
